# The Basics

## Simple SELECTs
1) Query all the data in the `pets` table.  
```sql
SELECT *
FROM pets;
```

2) Query only the first 5 rows of the `pets` table.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM pets
LIMIT 5;
```

3) Query only the names and ages of the pets in the `pets` table.
```sql
SELECT name, age
FROM pets;
```

4) Query the pets in the `pets` table, sorted youngest to oldest.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM pets
ORDER BY age ASC;
```

5) Query the pets in the `pets` table alphabetically.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM pets
ORDER BY name ASC;
```

6) Query all the male pets in the `pets` table.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM pets
WHERE sex='M';
```

7) Query all the cats in the `pets` table.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM pets
WHERE species='cat';
```

8) Query all the pets in the `pets` table that are at least 5 years old.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM pets
WHERE age>5;
```

9) Query all the male dogs in the `pets` table. Do not include the sex or species column, since you already know them.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM pets
WHERE sex='M' AND species='dog';
```

10) Get all the names of the dogs in the `pets` table that are younger than 5 years old.
```sql
SELECT name
FROM pets
WHERE age<5 AND species='dog';
```

11) Query all the pets in the `pets` table that are either male dogs or female cats.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM pets
WHERE (sex='M' AND species='dog') OR (sex='F' AND species='cat');
```

12) Query the five oldest pets in the `pets` table.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM pets
ORDER BY age DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

13) Get the names and ages of all the female cats in the `pets` table sorted by age, descending.
```sql
SELECT name, age
FROM pets
WHERE species='cat' AND sex='F'
ORDER BY age DESC;
```

14) Get all pets from `pets` whose names start with P.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM pets
WHERE name LIKE 'P%';
```

15) Select all employees from `employees_null` where the salary is missing.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees_null
WHERE salary IS NULL;
```

16) Select all employees from `employees_null` where the salary is below $35,000 or missing.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees_null
WHERE salary<35000 OR salary IS NULL;
```

17) Select all employees from `employees_null` where the job title is missing. What do you see?
```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees_null
WHERE job IS NULL;
-- I see one row (row 101), salary is -1 and everything else is UNKNOWN OR NULL.
```

18) Who is the newest employee in `employees`? The most senior?
```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
ORDER BY startdate DESC; --Roger Conner is the newest employee

SELECT *
FROM employees
ORDER BY startdate ASC; --Mary Nash is the most senior employee
```

19) Select all employees from `employees` named Thomas.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE firstname='Thomas';
```

20) Select all employees from `employees` named Thomas or Shannon.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE firstname='Thomas' OR firstname='Shannon';
```

21) Select all employees from `employees` named Robert, Lisa, or any name that begins with a J. In addition, only show employees who are _not_ in sales. This will be a little bit of a longer query.
    * _Hint:_ There will only be 6 rows in the result.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE (firstname='Robert' OR firstname='Lisa' OR firstname LIKE 'J%') AND job!='Sales';
```

## Column Operations
22) Query the top 5 rows of the `employees` table to get a glimpse of these new data.
```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
LIMIT 5;
```

23) Query the `employees` table, but convert their salaries to Euros. 
    * _Hint:_ 1 Euro = 1.1 USD.
    * _Hint2:_ If you think the output is ugly, try out the `ROUND()` function.
```sql
SELECT *, 
	ROUND(salary * 1.1) AS salary_in_euros
FROM employees;
```

24) Repeat the previous problem, but rename the column `salary_eu`.
```sql
SELECT *, 
	ROUND(salary * 1.1) AS salary_eu
FROM employees;
```

25) Query the `employees` table, but combine the `firstname` and `lastname` columns to be "Firstname, Lastname" format. Call this column `fullname`. For example, the first row should contain `Thompson, Christine` as `fullname`. Also, display the rounded `salary_eu` instead of `salary`.
    * _Hint:_ The string concatenation operator is `||`
```sql
SELECT *, 
	(lastname|| ', ' || firstname) AS fullname,
	ROUND(salary * 1.1) AS salary_eu
FROM employees;
```

26) Query the `employees` table, but replace `startdate` with `startyear` using the `SUBSTR()` function. Also include `fullname` and `salary_eu`.
```sql
SELECT *,
    (lastname || ', ' || firstname) AS fullname,
    ROUND(salary * 1.1) AS salary_eu,
    SUBSTR(startdate, 1, 4) AS startyear
FROM employees;
```

27) Repeat the above problem, but instead of using `SUBSTR()`, use `STRFTIME()`.
```sql
SELECT *,
    (lastname || ', ' || firstname) AS fullname,
    ROUND(salary * 1.1) AS salary_eu,
    STRFTIME('%Y', startdate) AS startyear
FROM employees;
```

28) Query the `employees` table, replacing `firstname`/`lastname` with `fullname` and `startdate` with `startyear`. Print out the salary in USD again, except format it with a dollar sign, comma separators, and no decimal. For example, the first row should read `$123,696`. This column should still be named `salary`.
    * _Hint:_ Check out SQLite's `printf` function.
    * _Hint2:_ The format string you'll need is `$%,.2d`. You should read more about such formatting strings as they're useful in Python, too!
```sql
SELECT *,
    (lastname || ', ' || firstname) AS fullname,
    printf('$%,.2d', salary) AS salary,
    STRFTIME('%Y', startdate) AS startyear
FROM employees;
```

**Note:** For the next few problems, you'll probably want to use `CASE`/`WHEN` statements.

29) Last year, only salespeople were eligible for bonuses. Create a column `bonus` that is "Yes" if you're eligible for a bonus, otherwise "No".
```sql
SELECT *,
	CASE
		WHEN job='Sales' THEN 'Yes'
		ELSE 'No'
		END AS bonus
FROM employees;
```

30) This year, only sales people with a salary of $100,000 or higher are eligible for bonuses. Create a `bonus` column like in the last problem for salespeople with salaries at least $100,000.
```sql
SELECT *,
	CASE
		WHEN job='Sales' AND salary>=100000 THEN 'Yes'
		ELSE 'No'
		END AS bonus
FROM employees;
```

31) Next year, the bonus structure will be a little more complicated. You'll create a `target_comp` column which represents an employee's target total compensation after their bonus. Here is the company's bonus structure:

* Salespeople who make more than $100,000 will be eligible for a 10% bonus.
* Salespeople who make less than $100,000 will be eligible for a 5% bonus.
* Administrators will also be eligible for a 5% bonus.
* Anyone who does not meet any of the above descriptions is not eligible for a bonus.
```sql
SELECT *,
	CASE
		WHEN job='Sales' AND salary>=100000 THEN '10%'
		WHEN job='Sales' AND salary<100000 THEN '5%'
		WHEN job='Administrator' THEN '5%'
		ELSE 'Not Eligible for a bonus'
		END AS target_comp
FROM employees;
```

Create this `target_comp` column, making sure to format _both_ the `salary` and `target_comp` columns nicely (ie, with dollar signs and comma separators).
```sql
SELECT *,
	PRINTF('$%,.2d', 
    CASE
		WHEN job='Sales' AND salary>=100000 THEN salary*1.1
		WHEN job='Sales' AND salary<100000 THEN salary*1.05
		WHEN job='Administrator'  THEN salary*1.05
		ELSE salary
	END) as target_comp
FROM employees;
```
